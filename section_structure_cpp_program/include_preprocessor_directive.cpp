//C++ Preprocessor processes your source code before the compiler. They take out all the comments and substitue them with one space.
//Preprocessor directives are lines that being with #, when the preprocessor processes #include it will take the fale referencing
// put it on top of your file and recursively process the whole file again.
// The C++ preprocessor only puts the files ready for the compiler, it does not understand C++, only directives.
